2. **Challenge**: "Think of a use case - let's build it live"
3. **Involve**: "You drag this node, I'll help configure it"

## 🚨 Backup Plans

### If Something Breaks:
1. **Refresh page** - templates reload automatically
2. **Use pre-exported JSON** - show the structure
3. **Switch to manual demo** - "Let me show you building from scratch"
4. **Focus on screenshots** - walk through visually

### If Time is Short:
1. **Skip manual build** - just show loaded template
2. **Skip JSON view** - focus on live testing
3. **Skip API deep-dive** - just mention "25 available"
4. **Show 2-3 nodes** - not all 16

### If Audience is Technical:
1. **Show JSON structure** - explain the schema
2. **Discuss API integration** - authentication, error handling
3. **Export format** - standards compliance
4. **Deployment model** - how it integrates
